## About WT-finder
WT-finder is a python script for identifying the wild-type peptide counterpart of the variant peptides missed by the proteomics searches. This tool searches the precursor mass of wild-type peptide within the user defined window corresponds to its variant peptide percursor mass. As the match found, the program further looks for its daugher ion and performs the matching in context of b and y ions.
The program provides a two outputs.

1. An image file with the peptides b and y ion match
2. Tab delimited output
